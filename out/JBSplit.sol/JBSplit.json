If a non-zero split hook contract is specified, this split's tokens are sent there along with this split's\n properties.\n @dev 2. Otherwise, if a non-zero project ID is specified, this split's tokens are used to `pay` it through its\n terminal if possible, or sent to the project's owner if not. If this payment yields tokens, those go to the split's\n `beneficiary`.\n @dev 3. Otherwise, this split's tokens are sent directly to the `beneficiary`.\n @dev To summarize, this split's tokens are sent according to the following priority: `split hook` > `projectId` >\n `beneficiary`.\n @custom:member preferAddToBalance If this split were to `pay` a project through its terminal, this flag indicates\n whether it should prefer using the terminal's `addToBalance` function instead.\n @custom:member percent The percent of the total token amount that this split sends. This number is out of\n `JBConstants.SPLITS_TOTAL_PERCENT`.\n @custom:member projectId The ID of a project to `pay`, if applicable. Resulting tokens will be routed to the\n `beneficiary`.\n @custom:member beneficiary Receives this split's tokens if the `hook` and `projectId` are zero. If the `projectId`\n is specified, the `beneficiary` receives any project tokens minted by this split.\n @custom:member lockedUntil The split cannot be changed until this timestamp. The `lockedUntil` timestamp can be\n increased while a split is locked.
