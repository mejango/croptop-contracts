# Croptop

Croptop opens up a project's NFT collection for contributions from anyone, so long as new posts meet criteria specified by the project owner.

## Install

For `npm` projects (recommended):

```bash
npm install @bananapus/721-hook
```

For `forge` projects (not recommended):

```bash
forge install Bananapus/nana-721-hook
```

Add `@bananapus/721-hook/=lib/nana-721-hook/` to `remappings.txt`. You'll also need to install `nana-721-hook`'s dependencies and add similar remappings for them.

## Develop

`nana-721-hook` uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management and the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) development toolchain for builds, tests, and deployments. To get set up, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
```

You can download and install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install && forge install
```

If you run into trouble with `forge install`, try using `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that nested submodules have been properly initialized.
